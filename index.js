//should create a class named Agable that takes a year and has an age method that calculates the age (current year - objects year) (use new Date().getFullYear() to get the current year)
//should inherit from Agable in Company class and pass yearEstablished to Agable in the constructor
//should inherit from Agable in Person class and pass birthYear to Agable in the constructor
//should inherit from Agable in Car class and pass year to Agable in the constructor
